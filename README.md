## What is Lobash?

Javascript has a powerful library [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).
Bash script development is complex and fallible. And shell script may be interpreted different with different shell and external commands (like BSD and GNU utilities).
So I write Lobash for enhancing shell script development efficiency and making it compatible with Bash and Zsh, MacOS and Linux System.

Lobash is a library not command. You should `source ./src/import.bash` to use Lobash.
It provides a `import` function to import Lobash modules (functions) .

If you do not know the difference between executing a Bash script and sourcing it, read [this](https://superuser.com/q/176783).

Lobash Features:

- Modular
- Easy to use
- Rich Functions
- Robust and Safe

## Build Status

- [Master Branch][]: [![Build Status/master](https://travis-ci.com/adoyle-h/lobash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/adoyle-h/lobash)
- [Develop Branch][]: [![Build Status/test](https://travis-ci.com/adoyle-h/lobash.svg?branch=test)](https://travis-ci.com/adoyle-h/lobash)

## Installation

```sh
# Download source codes
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/adoyle-h/lobash.git
# This step is optional. Clone submodules only if you want to run test cases.
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Prerequisites

2. Run Lobash modules in the shell from [Supported Shells List](#supported-shells).
3. Make sure [dependencies](#dependencies) installed.

### Supported Platform

|     ‚ùî    | BSD      | -       | Not tested yet. Maybe not support. |
|     üö´    | Windows  | -       | Never and ever supported.          |

### Supported Shells

| Supported | Shell    | Version          | Main Reasons                                       |
|:---------:|:---------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|

There is [a list](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/061) of which features were added to specific releases (versions) of Bash.

Ash/Ksh/Fish/Xiki and other shells are not supported because there are so many [differences](http://hyperpolyglot.org/unix-shells).

### Dependencies

- Perl 5.8.8 and higher.
  - No need install it by yourself. Almost Unix/Linux operating systems have included Perl 5. See the [Perl Binaries](https://www.cpan.org/ports/binaries.html)
  - Alpine not include Perl. Install it by `apk add perl`.
  - Busybox not include Perl. Install it by .
- Linux commands:
  - grep/awk/mktemp/dirname/basename/cd/printf/echo/wc
  - sed: BSD and GNU are both supported

## Usage

### Build your lobash.bash

First, build your own `lobash.bash` file by `./build`.

```sh
# build ./dist/lobash.bash
./build

# Or build Lobash to specific path
./build <target-path>

# Or build Lobash to specific path and change Lobash function prefix
PREFIX=lobash_ ./build <target-path>
```

When you use Lobash to build a library or framework, it is necessary to set `PREFIX` with unique namespace for avoiding naming collisions.
When you build a command, `PREFIX` is unnecessary.

The `PREFIX` only effect Lobash public functions and variables names.


### Load lobash.bash in your scripts

Second, load your own `lobash.bash` file in your scripts and all Lobash functions will be imported to current shell environment.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit
set -o nounset
set -o pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit

# It will load all Lobash modules
source <path-to-lobash.bash>
# Call l.<module_name> when PREFIX not set when building.
l.ask 'Hello Lobash?'

# Call <PREFIX>.<module_name> when PREFIX=lobash_ set
# lobash_ask 'Hello Lobash?'
```

All Lobash modules are written and tested with the shell options:

  - `set -o errexit`,
  - `set -o nounset`,
  - `set -o pipefail`
  - `shopt -s inherit_errexit`

**Lobash not enable these options by default. Make sure the same shell options enabled before call Lobash functions in your scripts. Otherwise there may be unexpected behaviors with it.**


Load `lobash.bash` is fast, nearly 0.058s.

```sh
time source ./dist/lobash.bash

real    0m0.058s
user    0m0.022s
sys     0m0.036s
```

## Module Usages

See [examples](./example/) and [./doc/module-usages.md](./doc/module-usages.md).

## Bin Command

Many modules not work as command.
The `./bin/lobash` command is only used for certain scenarios.

```sh
./bin/lobash <module_name> [<module_args>]...
```
