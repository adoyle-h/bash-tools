## What is Lobash?

Javascript has a powerful library [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).
Bash script development is complex and fallible. And shell script may be interpreted different with different shell and external commands (like BSD and GNU utilities).
So I write Lobash for enhancing shell script development efficiency and making it compatible with Bash and Zsh, MacOS and Linux System.

Lobash is a library not command. You should `source ./src/import.bash` to use Lobash.
It provides a `import` function to import Lobash modules (functions) .

If you do not know the difference between executing a Bash script and sourcing it, read [this](https://superuser.com/q/176783).

Lobash Features:

- Modular
- Easy to use
- Rich Functions
- Robustness and Safe

## Installation

```sh
# Download source codes
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/adoyle-h/lobash.git
# This step is optional. Clone submodules only if you want to run test cases.
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Prerequisites

1. All modules are written and tested with the shell options: `set -o errexit`, `set -o pipefail` and `shopt -s inherit_errexit`. Lobash not enable these options. Make sure the same shell options enabled by yourself, otherwise there may be unexpected behaviors with Lobash.
2. Run Lobash modules in the shell from [Supported Shells List](#supported-shells).
3. Make sure [dependencies](#dependencies) installed.

### Supported Platform

| Supported | Platform | Version | Main Reasons                       |
|:---------:|:---------|:--------|:-----------------------------------|
|     ‚úÖ    | MacOS    | *       | -                                  |
|     ‚úÖ    | Linux    | *       | -                                  |
|     ‚ùî    | BSD      | -       | Not tested yet. Maybe not support. |
|     üö´    | Windows  | -       | Never and ever supported.          |

### Supported Shells

| Supported | Shell    | Version          | Main Reasons                                       |
|:---------:|:---------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
|     ‚ùî    | Zsh      | v5 and higher    | Coming soon. Under compatible testing.             |
|     ‚ùî    | Bash     | v5 and higher    | Not tested yet.                                    |
|     ‚úÖ    | Bash     | v4.4             | -                                                  |
|     üö´    | Bash     | v4.3             | `shopt -s inherit_errexit` not supported util v4.4 |
|     üö´    | Bash     | v4.0, v4.1, v4.2 | Nameref not support util v4.3                      |
|     üö´    | Bash     | v3               | Associative array not supported  until v4.0        |
|     üö´    | POSIX sh |                  | `local` keyword not supported                      |

There is [a list](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/061) of which features were added to specific releases (versions) of Bash.

Ash/Ksh/Fish/Xiki and other shells are not supported because there are so many [differences](http://hyperpolyglot.org/unix-shells).

### Dependencies

- Perl 5.8.8 and higher.
  - No need install it by yourself. Almost Unix/Linux operating systems have included Perl 5. See the [Perl Binaries](https://www.cpan.org/ports/binaries.html)
  - Alpine not include Perl. Install it by `apk add perl`.
  - Busybox not include Perl. Install it by .
- Linux commands:
  - grep/awk/mktemp/dirname/basename/cd/printf/echo/wc
  - sed: BSD and GNU are both supported

## Usage

First, generate your own `lobash.bash` file by `./generate`.

```sh
# generate ./dist/lobash.bash
./generate

# or generate lobash to specific path
./generate <target-path>

# or generate lobash to specific path and change Lobash function prefix
PREFIX=lobash_ ./generate <target-path>
```

When you use Lobash to build a library or framework, it is necessary to set `PREFIX` with unique namespace for avoiding naming collisions.
When you build a command, `PREFIX` is unnecessary.

Second, load your own `lobash.bash` file in your scripts.

```sh
source <path-to-lobash.bash>
# All Lobash modules are loaded. If PREFIX not set when generated.
l.ask 'Hello Lobash?'

# If PREFIX=lobash_ set
# lobash_ask 'Hello Lobash?'
```

## Module Usages

See [examples](./example/) and [./doc/module-usages.md](./doc/module-usages.md).

## Bin Command

Many modules not work as command.
The `./bin/lobash` command is only used for certain scenarios.

```sh
./bin/lobash <module_name> [<module_args>]...
```

## Development

### Import specific modules for testing

```sh
source ./src/load_internals.bash
_lobash.import_internals module_meta
_lobash.import ask first last

l.ask hello world
l.first a b c
l.last a b c
```

### Debug

Set environment variable `LOBASH_DEBUG=true` to print verbose logs.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcomed. Please read [this document](./doc/contribution.md).

## Versioning

The versioning follows the rules of SemVer 2.0.0.

**Attentions**: anything may have **BREAKING CHANGES** at **ANY TIME** when major version is zero (0.y.z), which is for initial development and the public API should be considered unstable.

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
